# Blackjack Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game "21 Blackjack" using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows a single player to play against the computer dealer, with buttons for hitting or standing during the player's turn. The GUI displays the player's and dealer's scores, along with the game result. The game logic follows traditional rules, including special cases like blackjack and busts. This project provides an interactive and user-friendly way to enjoy the game of 21 Blackjack on the computer.
